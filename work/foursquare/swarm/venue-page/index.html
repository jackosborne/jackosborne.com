sparks curiosity to explore that place further. Yet, with City Guide now housing all the information about a place, users communicated that the experience often frustrated them. Could Swarm prioritise key elements that align with its core purpose while still offering a venue page without overlapping the content of its sister app?</p><p>In 2014, splitting the original Foursquare app into City Guide and Swarm allowed the company to separate functionality between personalised local recommendations and social check-ins. While this provided a more focused experience in each app, the product team received recurring feedback after the split: users were frustrated with the transition between the two apps and wanted a more efficient way to gather venue details within Swarm before navigating to City Guide.</p><h5>01â€”Discover</h5><h3>Understanding the Problem</h3><p>Before we dive in, it's important to note that Swarm did have a venue page, of sorts, at launch. As shown below, users could access specific details about a venue, including its address, the total and unique number of visitors, and a row showing if any friends had previously checked in. Additionally, information about the current Mayor<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">The user with the most check-ins at a venue over 30 days </span></span>was displayed at the bottom of the modal, along with a City Guide button that allowed users to browse a more comprehensive listing.</p><figure class="img"><div class="bg padding multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/3zNgIxynRE-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/3zNgIxynRE-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/JupId6z1Lo-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/JupId6z1Lo-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/b5O0HJo0mm-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/b5O0HJo0mm-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div><figcaption>Swarm Venue Card Flow 2014-2017 <span>Swarm Venue Page</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, many users were unaware of the additional information available in Swarm, as the venue name on the check-in detail (second screen) didn't appear to be interactive, leading to missed engagement opportunities. When users did access the page, they expressed dissatisfaction, feeling that the information provided was inadequate and didn't give them enough to form a clear opinion about the venue.</p><h5>02â€”Define</h5><h3>User Research and Insights</h3><p>Whether you were a seasoned Foursquare veteran or a recent sign-up, the call for more information echoed loudly through app store reviews. Users exploring competitor apps highlighted a clear opportunity: Swarm needed to offer more venue details to remain relevant and competitive. This feedback challenged us to reconsider a foundational question: could Swarm evolve while still honouring the purpose behind the app split?</p><figure class="img"><div><ul class="quotes"><li><strong>â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†<br>Love checking in on Swarm, but the lack of venue details is frustrating</strong> Having to hop over to City Guide for basic information disrupts the experience. A standalone venue page within Swarm would be a game-changer!</li><li><strong>â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†<br>App transition from Swarm to City Guide to get more context on a venue?</strong> It's a usability nightmare.

We resolved to bridge the gap between the two apps, ensuring Swarm could provide immediate, actionable insights about venues without compromising its focus on social discovery.</p><p>To guide this initiative, I facilitated a series of workshops to address a key challenge: how could we add meaningful venue details to Swarm without duplicating City Guide's functionality? By aligning stakeholders on this goal, we crafted user stories that focused on simplifying the venue discovery process while reinforcing Swarm's social-first identity<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">Seeing the context of a check-in in the Swarm social feed and getting a sense of what my friend(s) or other Foursquare users thought about the venue via the rating, tips and photos uploaded to that check-in/venue</span></span>. Through competitor analysis, I identified design patterns that balanced rich information with social interactivity. These findings helped shape early creative explorations, where mood boards and content blocks helped visualise how Swarm could uniquely present venue details without compromising its playful, social tone.</p><h5>03â€”Ideate</h5><h3>Identifying an Entry Point</h3><p>We explored several approaches to presenting venue information, each reflecting different priorities. One idea centred around an interactive bottom sheet that revealed more content as users pulled it up, offering a modern, more engaging experience. Another approach involved a static area, which displayed all relevant details upfront for simplicity and clarity. A third offered a simple modular card that would provide an entry point into a new view to reduce cognitive load on an already busy check-in detail.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/5hB63y402N-746.webp 746w"><img src="src/img/5hB63y402N-746.jpeg" width="746" alt="photo" height="497"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/bbwPVmu2G2-746.webp 746w"><img src="src/img/bbwPVmu2G2-746.jpeg" width="746" alt="photo" height="497"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/6SVHQ5fVg--486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/6SVHQ5fVg--486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/LtqNJ0LHc0-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/LtqNJ0LHc0-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/FTLrcI4ill-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/FTLrcI4ill-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/eTy2Z9Htpx-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/eTy2Z9Htpx-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/g_U6zxiQ5y-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/g_U6zxiQ5y-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/Olew9NON4p-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/Olew9NON4p-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Venue Page Explorations <span>Swarm Venue Page</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each concept raised interesting questions about Swarm's purpose and how venue details should integrate with its core social features. While dynamic elements like the bottom sheet introduced new paradigms, they did so at the risk of Swarm's social focus with features like stats<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">A feature that provided users with statistics highlighting their relationship with the venue</span></span> and comments from friends potentially being obscured or deprioritised. Conversely, the static area and card designs were straightforward but less engaging, potentially missing opportunities to enhance interaction.</p><p>Through iteration and testing, we found that the mini venue card struck the ideal balance between engagement and simplicity. It provided a concise snapshot of key information without detracting from Swarm's social features, seamlessly aligning with the app's flow and identity.</p><figure class="img"><div class="bg padding"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/TFcxlHVpf9-1133.webp 1133w"><img src="src/img/TFcxlHVpf9-1133.jpeg" width="1133" alt="photo" height="465"></picture></div><figcaption>Mini Venue Card States (Haven't Visited, Visited, Visited & Rated) <span>Swarm Venue Page</span></figcaption></figure><p>Designed to support Swarm's core purpose as a lifelog, the mini venue card supported two distinct modes: &quot;haven't visited&quot; and &quot;visited.&quot; For venues a user hadn't visited, the card would emphasise the actions of their friends, and for venues already visited, the card would transform into a more personalised experience, inviting users to add a rating and leave a tip.</p><p>This dual-mode approach ensured that venue interactions felt dynamic and meaningful, whether users explored new places or reflected on their experiences.</p><h3>Content as a Framework</h3><p>Recognising the growing demand for richer venue information, we decided it was imperative to move beyond the limitations of our existing modal-based venue page and transition to a more expansive view. To maintain focus, we streamlined the venue details to highlight social features like tips, ratings and saves. For those seeking more in-depth information, we would continue to lean on City Guide, which enabled users to explore comprehensive content without disrupting Swarm's social flow.</p><div style="overflow-x:auto;"><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>5.0</th><th>6.0</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic Info (Name, Location &amp; Meta Information)</td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td></tr><tr><td>Mayor, Facepiles &amp; Stats Block (Unqiue/Total Visitors &amp; Here Now)</td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td></tr><tr><td>City Guide Escape Hatch</td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td></tr><tr><td>User Interactions (Save, Rate, Write Tip &amp; Share)</td><td><span class="icon-check-no">No</span></td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td></tr><tr><td>Friends Generated Content (Photos &amp; Tips)</td><td><span class="icon-check-no">No</span></td><td><span class="icon-check-yes">Yes</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>At the heart of the redesign was the goal of immediately immersing users in a sense of community, and we opted to do this through user-generated photos.

We aimed to present enough information to support decision-making while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Insights from competitor analysis revealed that showcasing key venue details earlier in the user journey significantly improved usability, reinforcing our decision to prioritise this content upfront.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/-hNRhwGBE--1252.webp 1252w"><img src="src/img/-hNRhwGBE--1252.jpeg" width="1252" alt="photo" height="431"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/Wgj0eCoyyT-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/Wgj0eCoyyT-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="410"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/42aMuq1R-Z-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/42aMuq1R-Z-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="410"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/olMVdpIYLd-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/olMVdpIYLd-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="410"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Venue Information <span>Swarm Venue Page</span></figcaption></figure><p>I iterated through multiple sketches and mockups to streamline the layout, exploring ways to combine the map and venue details into a cohesive, user-friendly section. Guided by user feedback, we devised a design that balanced simplicity and functionality. The map became a dynamic element, allowing users to quickly pan, pinch, and zoom to explore their surroundings. Tapping the address block triggered an action sheet with quick access to navigation apps like Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Citymapper, making it effortless to get directions.</p><p>This concise, interactive approach aligned with Swarm's focus on spontaneous, social decision-making, contrasting with City Guide's more detailed and comprehensive venue pages.</p><h3>Showcasing Social Content</h3><p>As with most social networks, actual value emerges from cultivating a robust friend graph, and this section celebrates those connections by featuring tips from both you and your friends. Each tip includes the user's avatar, name, venue rating, and a short, tweet-length passage of text. Users can upvote a tip to show their agreement or appreciation, and the most recent upvote is displayed to highlight ongoing engagement.</p><p>Above the tips, a set of pills highlights key themes or popular topics related to the venue. These pills provide a quick snapshot of what people are discussing, offering users an easy way to grasp the venue's most talked-about aspects.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/7PfIO5XqgH-1252.webp 1252w"><img src="src/img/7PfIO5XqgH-1252.jpeg" width="1252" alt="photo" height="431"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/CRuJkPDuGf-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/CRuJkPDuGf-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="604"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/ihUJNhHndP-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/ihUJNhHndP-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="604"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/DNyboRREOB-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/DNyboRREOB-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="604"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Tastes & Tips Block <span>Swarm Venue Page</span></figcaption></figure><h5>04â€”Test</h5><h3>Testing and Feedback</h3><p>From the beginning, I prioritised low-to-medium fidelity designs, opting for black-and-white layouts that allowed for rapid iterations and unbiased feedback during internal reviews. This approach kept the focus on functionality and usability rather than aesthetics.</p><p>To gather diverse perspectives, we established a steady feedback loop, sharing weekly builds with employees and fortnightly updates with Superusers<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">Superusers (SUs) are the driving force behind the Foursquare community, tirelessly working to ensure the places database remains accurate and reliable</span></span>.
