information. But how can you make sure you don’t forget any places? The Saved Places feature provides an easy way to organize the venues you&#39;d like to visit and keep track of the ones you&#39;ve already been to.</p><p>When the original Foursquare app was split into City Guide and Swarm, the idea was that both apps would coexist and seamlessly hand off to each other, simplifying the overall experience for our users. City Guide would handle discovery and content curation, including lists and saved places, while Swarm would serve as your personal lifelog, cataloguing check-ins and memories.</p><p>Over time, it became clear that this separation disrupted the flow for users who wanted a unified way to save and revisit places. As part of our broader effort to reintegrate key features like venue pages back into Swarm, we saw an opportunity to bring saved places back, making the app a more complete tool for personal exploration and reflection.</p><h5>01—Discover</h5><h3>Understanding the Problem</h3><p>The concept of 'saving' content draws inspiration from various sources, but within Swarm, our primary focus was fostering social discovery. However, the inability to save places directly in Swarm created a disconnect between discovering venues and revisiting them later. This gap became a significant challenge, as users actively engaged socially in the app but lacked a seamless way to share those places with others.</p><p>Legacy users, in particular, voiced frustration with the cumbersome hand-off process between City Guide and Swarm, especially when it came to saving venues. Their feedback led us to re-evaluate aspects of the original app split, seeking opportunities to streamline the user experience and better integrate key functionalities.</p><figure class="img"><div class="bg padding multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/3zNgIxynRE-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/3zNgIxynRE-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/JupId6z1Lo-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/JupId6z1Lo-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/b5O0HJo0mm-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/b5O0HJo0mm-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/pLgNvHTIme-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/pLgNvHTIme-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div></div><figcaption>Swarm 1.0-4.0 Hand-Off Process <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><p>When users wanted to save a venue after seeing a friend's check-in on Swarm, the process was anything but seamless. They needed to click into the friend's check-in, tap the venue name to open a modal, and then select an option at the bottom to open the venue in the Foursquare City Guide app—only then could they save the venue. What should have taken one or two clicks required four, creating unnecessary friction.</p><p>While there were ways to shorten this flow, many users still felt the hand-off between apps took too long. This feedback made us question whether we could bring the same functionality directly into Swarm while preserving reasons for users to engage with our sister app, City Guide.</p><h5>02—Define</h5><h3>User Research and Insights</h3><p>User reviews from the app stores, along with insights from our community of Superusers<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">Superusers (SUs) are the passionate backbone of the Foursquare community, dedicated to maintaining the accuracy and quality of the company's places database</span></span>, played a pivotal role in defining this new feature. This feedback highlighted clear opportunities for improvement and underscored the need for a redesign that prioritised a seamless and intuitive experience for saving and sharing places.</p><figure class="img"><div><ul class="quotes"><li><strong>★★☆☆☆<br>Love the app, but it's frustrating</strong> Why do I have to switch between City Guide and Swarm to save places my friends are checking in to?</li><li><strong>★☆☆☆☆<br>The app was amazing before they split it into two</strong> Now, it's just clunky.

Drawing from the latest industry trends, I curated mood boards to inform early visual directions and mapped out user flows to identify potential pain points. These exercises inspired fresh ideas and revealed overlooked opportunities, deepening our understanding of user needs and refining their journeys.</p><h5>03—Ideate</h5><h3>Saving Venues</h3><p>Striking the right balance between usability and visibility was critical in deciding where to place the save button within our existing UI. Three options stood out: embedding it in the check-in feed cell, housing it within the check-in detail, or placing it in our venue page modal.</p><p>Placing it in the check-in cell was the least favourable option, as it risked adding visual clutter to an already detailed component. It also competed with another key action we wanted to prioritise—encouraging users to like their friends' check-ins.</p><figure class="img"><div class="bg padding"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/JIwgJxxgEt-1252.webp 1252w"><img src="src/img/JIwgJxxgEt-1252.jpeg" width="1252" alt="photo" height="496"></picture></div><figcaption>Current (Left) vs. Potential (Right) within a Checkin Detail Cell <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><p>That left two options: placing the save button on the check-in detail view or retaining it within the modal. Upon closer evaluation, when discussing the check-in detail, we realised that a save action didn't align with the page's purpose. This page highlights where a user was, who they were with, their impressions, and achievements like stickers or stats. Adding a save button felt out of place, as it didn't contribute to the user's experience of the check-in itself.</p><p>We then turned to the modal, giving a subtle visual refresh during a two-week experiment and introducing a more prominent save action. While this approach showed promising results, the modal's design still primarily reflected Swarm's older visual style. This prompted us to consider whether to overhaul the modal or move forward with a new, more discoverable venue page that better aligned with Swarm's focus on social discovery. Both options were explored, and ultimately, we chose the latter<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">If you're curious about our decision-making process, you can dive into the details in this <a href="/work/foursquare/swarm/venue-page/">case study</a></span></span>.</p><figure class="img"><div class="bg padding"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/b5O0HJo0mm-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/b5O0HJo0mm-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/0HAnNALLSN-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/0HAnNALLSN-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/8Ni_u69xan-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/8Ni_u69xan-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Existing Modal vs Visual Overhaul vs Venue Page <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Housing the Experience</h3><p>Adopting a simplified perspective, Swarm operates as a two-tab app, with the user's profile accessible from the top-left corner of the navbar in both views. This streamlined design offers a clean user experience but inherently limits the available real estate for additional features. As a result, the placement options for this new functionality were somewhat constrained, requiring careful consideration to avoid disrupting the app's balance and usability.</p><p>As a result, the user's profile emerged as a natural and prominent choice for this feature, as it already housed significant app usage information: photos, friends, check-ins<span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">The key distinction between Check-ins and Visited Places lies in their focus: while Check-ins provided a chronological list of all your activities, Visited Places would consolidate multiple check-ins at the same venue into a single grouping</span></span>, categories, stickers, streaks, and mayorships.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/UUZLymJUdE-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/UUZLymJUdE-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/4QLNARu6VK-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/4QLNARu6VK-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/vRKzqCAC4i-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/vRKzqCAC4i-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div><figcaption>Swarm Profile 1.0–4.0 (Previous), 5.0 (Present) & 6.0 (Proposed) <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Exploring Bottom Sheets</h3><p>A few months before this project began, Android and iOS introduced bottom sheets, shifting interaction patterns from top-heavy to bottom-heavy layouts. These sheets quickly gained traction across apps, signalling their growing popularity and setting new industry trends. By allowing information to be presented seamlessly without disrupting the user's flow, they offered a promising solution to Foursquare's longstanding dilemma: &quot;Do users prefer to browse via a list or a map?&quot; <span class="aside-anchor" aria-hidden=""></span><span class="aside" role="complementary"><span class="aside__content">Research had consistently shown our users being firmly divided between the two approaches: lists vs. maps</span></span></p><p>As part of the design process, we conducted weekly testing sessions to evaluate different iterations of bottom sheets. These sessions allowed users to engage with various layouts and explore how content was presented, giving us valuable insights into how they navigated and processed information.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/twlB1Q8KMr-1252.webp 1252w"><img src="src/img/twlB1Q8KMr-1252.jpeg" width="1252" alt="photo" height="834"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/dJqPJRBrlY-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/dJqPJRBrlY-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/HYyfszEh0S-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/HYyfszEh0S-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/6rRBF8L7BT-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/6rRBF8L7BT-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Sketches & Wireframes of Bottom Sheet <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><p>Insights from testing sessions reaffirmed that the map should be our compelling visual centrepiece. To achieve this, we designed the bottom sheet to render in a collapsed position before sliding to its default state. Testing revealed that showing the map first helped set the user context, especially when it was populated with more data. Once the bottom sheet slid up, it introduced an additional interaction layer, enabling users to dive deeper into the data through a detailed, list-based format.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/w99t0DP57n-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/w99t0DP57n-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/1KX99Uytbr-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/1KX99Uytbr-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/OYy6DF2ZNs-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/OYy6DF2ZNs-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/I7BAxULpuM-358.webp 358w"><img src="src/img/I7BAxULpuM-358.jpeg" width="358" alt="photo" height="636"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Bottom Sheet Interactivity <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><p>By allowing the map to occupy 70% of the vertical space on the page load, we signalled that the bottom sheet operated independently from the map and could be swiped upward. This design allowed users to explore the map while seamlessly transitioning to a full-page list view when the sheet was swiped up entirely. The dual interaction—map first, followed by the bottom sheet—reinforced the flexibility of navigating between map-based and list-based information without feeling disconnected.</p><h3>Balancing Interactions</h3><p>To reinforce the map as a compelling visual centrepiece, we needed to ensure that the bottom sheet adapted dynamically to user interactions. Whenever users engaged with the map, the bottom sheet would collapse, allowing the map to take over the entire screen and remain the focal point.</p><p>The bottom sheet would stay in its collapsed state until a map pin was selected. At that point, it would slide back up to display key details. From there, the user could tap on the venue cell to access the venue page.</p><figure class="img"><div class="multi col"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/mKEWNjlCD_-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/mKEWNjlCD_-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/kJJ_R-C_ZY-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/kJJ_R-C_ZY-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/7f5COGY47F-486.webp 486w"><img src="src/img/7f5COGY47F-486.jpeg" width="486" alt="photo" height="864"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Map & Bottom Sheet Interactivity <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><h5>04—Test</h5><h3>Testing and Feedback</h3><p>Creating the Saved Places feature was an iterative process shaped by feedback from our team and the Foursquare community. Early on, I used low-fidelity black-and-white prototypes to focus on functionality and make quick changes. This helped us test ideas and refine the feature before moving to more polished designs.</p><p>As we progressed, we shared weekly builds with employees for internal feedback and bi-weekly builds with our Superuser community. Superusers shared screenshots and recordings through Slack, helping us spot usability issues and uncover new ideas. This combination of internal and external feedback gave us a well-rounded view of users' needs. It allowed us to improve the feature step by step and ensure it fits seamlessly into the app before launching.</p><h3>Design Revisions</h3><div style="overflow-x:auto;"><table><thead><tr><th>Issue</th><th>Initial Design</th><th>Feedback</th><th>Change Implemented</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Saved &amp; Visited Views</strong></td><td>Separate entry points pushed distinct pages.</td><td>Users found switching between the two views inconvenient due to their similarity.</td><td>Introduced a tab bar at the top of the bottom sheet for seamless toggling.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bottom Sheet Navigation</strong></td><td>Collapsed when the map was panned, fetching new data and reactivating slowly.</td><td>Users described this process as slow and cumbersome, with no easy way to return to a previous state.</td><td>Added a breadcrumb menu to anchor navigation, enabling users to return to previous states without relying on the map.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><figure class="img"><div class="multi col bg padding"><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/MbMi80Iu83-1252.webp 1252w"><img src="src/img/MbMi80Iu83-1252.jpeg" width="1252" alt="photo" height="834"></picture></div></div><div class="multi row"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/KMj7KWgdqA-746.webp 746w"><img src="src/img/KMj7KWgdqA-746.jpeg" width="746" alt="photo" height="372"></picture></div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/TLQ3fd2q9g-746.webp 746w"><img src="src/img/TLQ3fd2q9g-746.jpeg" width="746" alt="photo" height="372"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption>Addition of Breadcrumbs and Tab bar <span>Swarm Saved Places</span></figcaption></figure><h5>05—Release</h5><h3>Room For Improvement</h3><p>As we reflect on the recent launch of our new feature, we recognise that there are areas for improvement to enhance the overall user experience. One notable limitation is the inability to create separate lists directly; users must rely on the City Guide for this functionality.</p><p>Furthermore, we have noted occasional slowness in page interactions, and we understand the importance of optimising the app's speed to ensure a seamless user journey. While innovative, the smart grouping of places based on locale has raised questions about its effectiveness, and we are actively considering adjustments to ensure a more intuitive and user-friendly grouping system.</p><p>Finally, we recognise the need for more diverse sorting options in list and map views, which would provide users with greater flexibility in organising and accessing their saved content.</p></div><div class="meta"><div><h5>Responsibilities</h5><ul><li>Prototyping</li><li>Sketching</li><li>UI Design</li><li>User Testing</li><li>UX Design</li></ul></div><div><h5>Team</h5><ul><li>Matthew Dyson</li><li>David Hwang</li><li>Adell Hanson-Kahn</li><li>Avneesh Kohli</li><li>Fuad Mohamoud</li><li>Saumya Soman</li><li>Tonie Wan</li><li>Jay Zhou</li></ul></div><div><h5>Platform</h5><p>Android &amp; iOS</p></div><div><h5>Year</h5><p>2018</p></div></div></div></article></main><footer role="contentinfo"><ul><li><a href="#"><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 22 22" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11 18V4" stroke="var(--text-emph)" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></path><path d="M4 11L11 4L18 11" stroke="var(--text-emph)" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg> Back To Top</a></li><li>&copy; 2005–2025 Jack Osborne</li></ul></footer></div><script src="/_/js/project.min.js?hash=3bab-1c43-c380"></script></body></html>
